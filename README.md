# My Task Application project

Hello there! My name is David, I'm a beginner full-stack developer and I'm proud of presenting the Task Manager I built while learning the React basics, I hope you to enjoy it!

As it is deployed, you only have to enter to the link to try it

## The technologies I used
Like the major part of modern applications, this Task Manager is built in React + TypeScript + Vite.

In this moment, the initial data I'm using is a mocked data while I do similar full-stack projects where I'll use a database and a back-end framework. So... Pay attention to my GitHub to see all my next creations 👨‍💻

## Local setup
If you want to setup the project in your computer there are simple setps to follow in your terminal
- ```git clone https://github.com/davidpalacin/todo-app.git```
- Enter in the project's folder
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run dev```
- It's already opened in your default browser 😀
